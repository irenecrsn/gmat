====

An R package for simulating covariance and concentration graph matrices.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/irenecrsn/gmat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/irenecrsn/gmat) [![CRAN downloads](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/gmat)](http://cran.r-project.org/package=gmat) [![CRAN status](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/gmat)](http://cran.r-project.org/package=gmat)

This package implements the methods described in the [paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v72/cordoba18a.html):

> Córdoba, I., Varando, G., Bielza, C. and Larrañaga, P. A partial orthogonalization method for simulating covariance and concentration graph matrices, Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PGM 2018), vol. 72, pp. 61 - 72, 2018.

It is governed by two main functions, `port` and `diagdom`, which take as input an undirected graph structure `ug` and a sample size `N`, and generates `N` covariance/concentration matrices subject to the zeros imposed by the undirected graph structure `ug`.

The sample is generated by `port` with the method described in the above paper. The classical diagonal dominance method is the one used by function `diagdom`.

Installation
------------

The package is available on `CRAN`, to get the latest stable version use

``` r
install.packages("gmat")
```

Alternatively, using the R package `devtools` one may install the current development version:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("irenecrsn/gmat")
```

The only R package required for `gmat` is `igraph`, which can also be installed from CRAN.

An example of use
-----------------

First, we generate a random graph with `3` nodes and density `0.25`, using the `igraph` package. Then we generate, using our `gmat::port` function, `3` matrices consistent with such random graphical structure.

``` r
ug <- igraph::sample_gnp(n = 3, p = 0.25)
matrices <- gmat::port(N = 3, ug = ug)
matrices
#> , , 1
#> 
#>          [,1]      [,2]    [,3]
#> [1,] 1.384589 0.0000000 0.00000
#> [2,] 0.000000 0.1407549 0.00000
#> [3,] 0.000000 0.0000000 0.42667

#> [1,] 1.194257 0.0000000 0.0e+00
#> [2,] 0.000000 0.2235405 0.0e+00
#> [3,] 0.000000 0.0000000 6.3e-06
```

We apprieciate how the zero pattern is shared by all of the simulated matrices. The return value is an array, and so the individual matrices can be accessed as `matrices[, , n]`, where `n` is the index of the matrix we want to retrieve from the sample, ranging from `1` to `N`.
