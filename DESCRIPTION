Description: Simulation of correlation matrices possibly constrained by a given undirected or acyclic directed graph. In particular, the package provides functions that implement the simulation methods described in C칩rdoba et al. (2018) <doi:10.1007/978-3-030-03493-1_13> and C칩rdoba et al. (2020) <doi:10.1016/j.ijar.2020.07.007>.
